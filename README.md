# ✈️ tripMe - GenAI Flight Booking Sim
Experience the future of travel planning. No forms, just conversation.

# 🚀 Overview
GenAI Flight Booking Sim is a next-generation flight reservation simulator powered by Generative AI. Instead of navigating through clunky dropdowns and date pickers, users can simply state their travel plans in natural language (e.g., "I need a flight from Kolkata to Bangalore next Friday for under ₹5k"), and the system intelligently parses the intent to find and "book" the best options.

Built with a lightweight Node.js backend and a responsive vanilla HTML/JS frontend, this project demonstrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can revolutionize user experience (UX) in the travel industry.

# ✨ Key Features
Natural Language Processing: Ditch the search filters. Just type what you want, and our GenAI agent understands origins, destinations, dates, and budget constraints.

Intelligent Itinerary Matching: The system dynamically filters available flight data to match complex user queries.

Real-time Simulation: Simulates the end-to-end booking flow, from query to confirmation, providing an instant feedback loop.

Responsive UI: A clean, minimal interface that focuses purely on the conversation and results.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
### Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (simplicity for speed)

### Backend: Node.js, Express.js (handling API requests)

### AI/LLM Integration: AMADEUS, Google Gemini API

### Environment Management: Dotenv for secure API key handling
